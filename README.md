MappedIn

===========
Our team won second place at this hackathon
We built MappedIn, an iOS mobile dynamic population heatmapper. Takes in mobile geolocation data and 
heatmaps it by population density over a geospatially overlaid map of Outsidelands.
Also keeps track of a phone's location throughout the day and can reproduce a path through the concert.
Finally, using Spotify's API, displays the artist playing at each location, tagged by geolocation.

============ 
Look at branch shana_playground 
- Worked on front-end iOS app development. Made HTTP POST requests to continuously record phone location, and GET 
requests through the Spotify API to receive Json file artist metadata to display on pins 
representing different concert stages.
